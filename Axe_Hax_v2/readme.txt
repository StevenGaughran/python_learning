Version 2 of Axe Hax.

The major update here is sifting through available data to list Axe's best and worst matchups. This data doesn't seem to match with DotaBuff so it's possible I did something wrong.

I also streamlined the files and cleaned up some code. I got rid of the UI file altogether and pushed it all to main, since it was the only thing in main anyway.
