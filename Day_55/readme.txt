Day 55 - Working with Flask.

The final project for the day was pretty straighforward, though a lot of the lesson was a bit of a mindjob.

I am not even going to pretend that I've got a grasp on Python decorators or how they work properly.

The good news(?) is that I think I now understand why you'd use Flask instead of straight HTML for basic websites like this, which is something I was wondering the day before.
