Day 38.

The Nutritionix portion of this project was a breeze, despite it being 90% of the code. Clean and easy. I feel like I've got a solid handle on dicitonaries and JSON data at this point, as well as API pulls.

The Sheety portion, however, was a small nightmare due to its miserable documentation. The heroes of the day were once again in the lesson comments, since the JSON data had to be uploaded with a very specific naming convention which, if I'm being honest, made no sense to me, and still doesn't.
