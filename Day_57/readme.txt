Day 57.

More work with Flask and introducing Jinja concepts.

The in-class challenges went well up until this "capstone" project, where I was inexplicably stuck for a time. I peeked at the class "solution" and found it to be dizzyingly complex, and went back to the way I was doing it. 

As it turns out, my way worked just fine: I needed to convert one of my awargs from a string to an integer. A simple fix! Hooray!
