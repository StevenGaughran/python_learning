Day 35.

This lesson was wild. The instructor wanted us to use Twilio to push out SMS notifications, but my phone doesn't play nice with SMS, so I had to use a different method: making a Telegram bot. It seems to have worked alright, but it took some time to work it out. Overall, it seems to work.

Also, I'm not sure if I set up the PythonAnywhere correctly to run the script. I guess I'll find out later.

I didn't do the part of the lesson where we hid auth keys in the environment because I ran out of time. I'll do some reasearch about it later.
