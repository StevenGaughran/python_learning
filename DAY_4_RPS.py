#Let me be on record as saying that Day 4 of this course was absolute bullshit. So 'owly' as to be offputting. I learned more from the comments section than the actual lecture, which was not sufficient for the needs of the exercises. 

#Ultimately I think I was supposed to use lists to do this, but I haven't fully figured everything out yet because I found the lesson frustrating. I'll have to return to it in a day or so and give it another once-over once I'm less frustrated.

# Anyway, here's 'Wonderwall'

#The actual RPS part. Tried using a list like the lessons "taught" us, but I had a real bitch of a time with it. I had created the "grid," but couldn't figure out how to call on it properly. Thankfully, a fellow named "Howard" in the comments had the same idea, and his insight helped me substantially. Howard, wherever you are: you're a gem.

#Okay, so this works now, but it took longer than I would care to admit. I am going to go drink some wine now.
