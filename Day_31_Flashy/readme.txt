Day 31, a flash card program.

I once again got 90% through this project before having to throw in the towel and look at the solution.

I *really* struggled with the data manipulation in this exercise. Like, a lot. I'm still confused. My grasp of data structures is apparently entirely substandard. Extremely discouraging.

I don't like that we're using global variables yet again. I don't like that the lessons keep expecting us to know how to use things without teaching us.

As you can see, I'm in a bad mood.
