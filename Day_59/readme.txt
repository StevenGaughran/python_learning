So last night in bed, just as I was about to fall asleep, my brain whispered, "Hey, you up?"

"Obviously," I whispered. "The hell do you want?"

"So you know those url_for commands in Flask?" Brain said.

"Yeah. What about them?"

"This is the reason they work."

"...what? Really?"

"Yeah."

"And you're telling me this now? It's almost midnight, for Chrissakes!"

"And you're welcome."

So anyway, I decided to work on this project again. And I think I almost grasp the Flask basics at this point, though I could be wrong about that. For some reason the blog post pages in this version refuse to pull up the proper Boostrap formatting, and after almost an hour of slamming my head into the problem I decided to let it go.
